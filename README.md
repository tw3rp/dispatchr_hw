## Homework for various intuition based problem solving 

* Write a function to determine if a string has all unique characters.  How do you do this if you cannot use any additional data structures?  For the second part, declaring new variables is OK, but using something like an array is not.  Assume you don't know the size of the alphabet used to construct the string (e.g. it may be [a-z], or [a-z, A-Z], or all of unicode, ...)

* Write a function to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list (single or double, doesn't matter - you choose).  What if you cannot use a temporary buffer?

*  Assume you are given an array of n integers, and will be expecting more coming in a stream (maybe this is implemented as a websocket).  You need to display the average (the mean) of the integers, and update it as the stream comes in.  The initial calculation on the array takes O(n) time.  As the stream starts, is it possible to update the average in O(1) time? If so, how?
